What i wanna learn:
  1. Animator (Done)
  2. Maybe create in blender own Humanoid with animations (only 30% done, Rigging killed me). Maybe someday but not now.
  3. Test my camera script (Pretty good, it was needed a little tweak).
  4. Test UserInput script (Done, Rewrited to work with Standart asset Thirs Person Character AnimationController).
